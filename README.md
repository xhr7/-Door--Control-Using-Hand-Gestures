Abstract:

the servo angle mechanism for opening and closing doors offers a promising solution for automating door operations. Its ability to provide precise control, remote accessibility, and enhanced safety makes it a compelling choice for various applications. Further research and development in this field can lead to advancements in automated door systems, improving convenience and accessibility in everyday life.

Introduction

In This project we have developed a door control system using hand gestures and servo motors, The traditional methods of door control often involve physical contact or the use of buttons or switches. However, by leveraging advancements in computer vision, gesture recognition, and servo motor technology, this project seeks to provide a touchless and intuitive way of controlling doors, and our project is designed to provide a touchless and hygienic way of controlling doors, making it suitable for various environments, including public spaces, commercial buildings, or homes. It offers convenience and ease of use, as users can simply perform a hand gesture to open or close the door without the need for physical contact or manual operation.
